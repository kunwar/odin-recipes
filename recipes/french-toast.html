    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      It's easier than you think to make restaurant-quality French toast in the
      comfort of your own kitchen â€“ you just need a skillet, a few staple
      ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in!
    </p>
    <p>
      The best breads for French toast are brioche, sourdough, French bread, or
      challah. These varieties are dense and sturdy enough to handle total
      saturation in the wet, milky, egg custard without falling apart. However,
      in a pinch, any thick-sliced white bread will do.
